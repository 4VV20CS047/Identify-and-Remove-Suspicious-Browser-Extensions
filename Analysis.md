# Task 7 Analysis: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
The goal of Task 7 was to review, identify, and remove any unused or suspicious browser extensions to improve security and browser performance.

## Steps Taken

1. **Opened Extension Manager**
   - Accessed the browserâ€™s extension/add-ons manager to view all installed extensions.

2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions**
   - Carefully examined the list of installed extensions.
   - Checked their purpose, usage frequency, and source.

3. **Checked Permissions and Reviews**
   - Verified permissions granted to each extension.
   - Looked up reviews and developer credibility online.

4. **Identified Suspicious/Unused Extensions**
   - Marked extensions that were either not in use or seemed unnecessary.

5. **Removed Unnecessary Extension**
   - Removed **Wappalyzer** as it was not required for daily activities.

6. **Restarted Browser**
   - Restarted the browser to ensure the removal process was complete.

7. **Performance Check**
   - Verified that the browser performance improved slightly after cleanup.

8. **Research on Risks of Malicious Extensions**
   - Learned that malicious extensions can:
     - Track browsing history
     - Steal login credentials
     - Inject unwanted ads or malicious scripts
     - Slow down browser performance

## Conclusion
The removal of unused extensions reduces the attack surface for malicious activities and helps maintain better browser performance. This proactive security measure is part of good cybersecurity hygiene.
